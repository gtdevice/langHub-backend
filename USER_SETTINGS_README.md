  "language_level": "A2"
}
```

**Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "user_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "main_language": "French",

}
```

#### 4. **DELETE /user-settings/me** - Delete Current User Settings

### Error Handling
All endpoints include proper error handling for:
- Authentication failures (401 Unauthorized)
- Missing user settings (404 Not Found)
- Duplicate settings creation (400 Bad Request)
- Database connection issues (500 Internal Server Error)

## Summary
All user settings CRUD operations have been successfully implemented and tested. The system is ready for production use.
